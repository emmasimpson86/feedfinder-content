# About Page
This website and mobile application, FeedFinder are part of an ongoing Digital Civics research project at Newcastle University. 

FeedFinder is a free mobile app used by over 12000 women world wide to find, rate and review places based on how breastfeeding friendly they are. Understanding womens experiences when breastfeeding in public allows us to create supportive environments. 

Over the last three years have been working in collaboration with local breastfeeding mothers, public health improvement practitioners and infant feeding coordinators in the North East of England to improve breastfeeding support in our local communities. 
As part of this ongoing research, we have developed this website to improve access to the review data from FeedFinder along with other public health datasets.
